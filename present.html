            <h1>In the present day, climate change is impacting us in many different ways, and the impacts are more and more obvious every year. These effects include:</h1>
            <p></p>
            <p>- Increase in natural disasters and extreme weather conditions. We can see this with the droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires in California. In other places in the world, we can see an increase in floods and hurricanes. All these weather conditions causes people to be harmed and puts our communities and homes at risk. These extreme weather conditions also cause a food shortage, as crops are much more likely to die with less rain and temperatures not suitable for growing them. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>- Global warming and sea level rising. As the Earth gets warmer and warmer, glaciers and ice sheets all around the globe are melting into the ocean, causing our sea level to rise. This causes flooding and erosion of land near oceans to occur more often, putting our coastal communities in the most danger. Another issue with rising sea levels is due to erosion and flooding, our fresh water can be very easily taminated by the salt water, destroying important habitats in our ecosystem.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>- Health and safety issues, especially towards communites that live closer to factories with a lot of carbon emmissions. These communites live closer to air pollution causing resipitory problems, not to mention miscarriage is increased due to the poor air condition as well. Communites close to factories also tend to be poorer minorities, which makes getting healthcare even more difficult for them and the enviornment they live in to be much more subscpetible to crime. Climate change has also caused mosquito-borne diseases to spread easier, like malaria and dengue fever.</p>  
            <p></p>
            <p>- Our economoy is taking a massive hit having to fund the damages caused by climate change alone. Not to mention, workers are being allocated to help repair the damages. This will continue to increase until we start actually putting our money into stopping climate change, not just fixing what's broken.</p> 
            <p></p>
            <h1>All these issues will continue to worsen until we put a stop to climate change.</h1>

                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p> I am a student at UCSD who is passionate towards helping end climate change. Many people still 
                        do not believe that climate change is a real thing or just choose to ignore it. I compiled this website 
                        to help spread accurate information about climate change to as wide of an audience as possible.
